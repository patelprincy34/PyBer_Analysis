# Overview of the PyBer Analysis
## Purpose of the Project
#### The purpose of the project is to conduct exploratory analysis of Pyber ride-sharing data in order to acquire a better knowledge of ridership and fare metrics by Pyber operating cities. Creating rideshare data visualizations for PyBer to aid in improving access to ride-sharing services and determining cost in underdeveloped areas.

## Resources
* Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv, PyBer_ride_data.csv
* Source Code: PyBer_Challenge_starter_code

## Results 
#### Statistics overview and summary based on the analysis and aggregation of PyBers ride sharing data.

##### We can see from the summary that there are several key findings, including:
  * Ridership demand is higher in urban areas, whereas it is lowest in rural areas.
  * Drivers in urban cities outnumber those in suburban cities by more than 4 times
  * With roughly 4.5 times the revenue, suburban cities have 6 times the number of drivers as rural cities.
  * The average fare per ride and driver is greatest in rural cities. 
  * The summary data reveals that when there is a higher ratio of drivers to riders, fare revenue is higher per city type. 
#### The multiple-line chart "Total Fare by City Type"

##### The multiple-line chart "Total Fare by City Type" further supports the PyBer Summary DataFrame
  * It shows trends of total fares in rural, suburban, and urban cities between January 2019 and April 2019.
  * The yellow trend shows how fares in urban cities totaled from around $1,600 to $1,900 from beginning to end during this four-month period.
  * The blue trend shows how fares in rural cities totaled around $300 from beginning to end during the same time period.
  * The orange trend shows how the total fares in suruban cities fall in between urban and rural cities: around $700 to $1,200 from beginning to end during the same time period.
  * The chart further demonstrates similar peak times in all these types of cities. One noteworthy peak in total fares among urban, suburban, and rural cities occurred sometime at the end of February 2019.

## Summary 
##### Three Business recommendations for Pyber based on Pyber data analysis are: 
  * Lower the cost of fare per ride in rural and urban cities. High average cost of fare per ride in rural and urban cities can discourage potential riders form using PyBer.
  * Increase the number of drivers in rural citites. More drivers can also mean lower fare per ride in rural cities which would incourge potential riders to use PyBer.
  * Increase fare earing per driver in urban areas to incourage more divers in urban cities. Lower fair earnig could discourage potential drivers working with PyBer.
